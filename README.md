# Front End Starter

## Get Started

**First and foremost,** make sure that your local machine is set up with all of the 'dev environment tooling' as per [this guide...](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Setting-up-a-Local-Dev-Environment-for-JS-02a4e9f4a30043d3a8e7d109be3448f4)

After establishing your directory structure on your local machine, (e.g. '~/Code'), kindly [follow these girections](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) - essentially, there should be a button 👆🏾that says **Use this template.**

Once this repo has been created on your GitHub, you can click on the button to `clone` it as usual. Once it's `clone`d to your local machine, kindly `cd` into the directory and **be sure to do:** `npm i` to build out 'node_modules'. This will provide you with some helpful tooling and linting.

Now, enter `code .` to open this project in VS Code, and look for a prompt to 'install some extensions' once inside VS Code (in the bottom right of your screen). You should install these. 👍🏾

Update this README and make any other initial changes or 🌱 files, etc. To help you do that, here's a [Markdown Guide](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/MarkDown-Guide-3c7aecdc1327437e9785cb9c1d277f42)

## HW - 5 pts.

1. Complete the `// TODO` in 'index.js' using `for` - `commit` this!
2. Complete the `// TODO` in 'index.js' using `map` - `commit` this!
3. Refactor ♻️ your `map` to use _arrow syntax._ - `commmit` this!
4. Use a `for` loop to build a new _array_ that **only** includes users that have an ✉️ ending in `.biz`. [**HINT:** `String.prototype.endsWith()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/endsWith)
